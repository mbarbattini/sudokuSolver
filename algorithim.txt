Rules:  each number must be used in each 3x3 grid
        each number must be used in each row
        each number must be used in each column

Find some empty space
Attempt to place the digits 1-9 in that space
Check if that digit is valid in the current spot based on the current board
 a. If the digit is valid, recursively attempt to fill the board using steps 1-3.
b. If it is not valid, reset the square you just filled and go back to the previous step.
Once the board is full by the definition of this algorithm we have found a solution.
