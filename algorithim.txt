Rules:  each number must be used in each 3x3 grid
        each number must be used in each row
        each number must be used in each column

Algorithm:

    for every 3x3 grid
        check if it is a valid grid
            not: start grid test
            Yes: check the next grid. Recursion
        if all grids are correct
            check every row
                True: check every column
                False: correct error

        grid test:
            for i in range(1:9):
                loop through every cell in grid:
                    if grid != i
                        place i in that spot


        for every 3x3 grid
            valid numbers = [1:9]
            for all cells in a 3x3 grid
                if cell has a number
                    remove number from arr
            place the valid number in [0,0]
                check if row requirement is satisfied
                    false: try next number
                    true: continue
                check if col requirement is satisfied
                    false: try next number
                    true: place number in the spot
                        remove number from valid number arr
                no valid:
                    dont place the number, move on to next

            if grid is finished but incomplete
                move on to the next grid
            
            if grid is finished
                move on to the next grid
